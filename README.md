# csv-combine-script

This script is meant to combine files from multiple different CSV files into one output file using `awk`. Feel free to edit to suit your needs. 

# Instructions for Use

Open a terminal and enter the following commands:

```
git clone git://github.com/jperkins1/csv-combine-script/
cd csv-combine-script/
chmod a+x macos-csv-combine-script.sh
./macos-csv-combine-script.sh
```

You'll have to enter your password, 
Enter the directory where your CSV files are stored, and press enter. That will produce a file called `output.csv` that will contain the 3rd column of all the CSV files in the directory you specified.
