# csv-combine-script

This script is meant to combine files from multiple different CSV files into one output file using `awk`. Feel free to edit to suit your needs. 

# Instructions for Use

Once you have the code on your local machine, either from the `git clone` command or through the download button on Github, open a terminal and enter the following commands

```
cd csv-combine-script/
chmod a+x csv-combine-script.sh
./csv-combine-script.sh
```

Enter the directory where your CSV files are stored, and press enter. That will produce a file called `output.csv` that will contain the 3rd column of all the CSV files in the directory you specified.
